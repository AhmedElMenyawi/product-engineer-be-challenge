# üìå Who, What, When - API Challenge

Welcome to the Hello Chef take-home challenge!

This project simulates a simple but powerful system used internally by our team: tracking **Who** is doing **What**, and **When**. It‚Äôs inspired by real accountability tools used by different teams at Hello Chef and we‚Äôre excited to see how you bring it to life.

---

## The Goal

Build a backend API that lets users:
- Create and assign tasks to people (`Who`)
- Describe what needs to be done (`What`)
- Define a time range (`When`)
- Mark things as complete ‚úÖ

This isn‚Äôt about scale or completeness, we want to see your **code clarity, product thinking, and ownership mindset**.

---

## Core Requirements

Your solution should demonstrate your ability to design and build a simple but usable API that supports a recurring workflow like team accountability or planning.
At a minimum, it should let users:

- Create people and assign them responsibilities (‚Äúwho‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù)
- Set a time range for each commitment (‚Äúwhen‚Äù)
- Mark things as done
- View a filtered list of commitments
- Remove an entry

You‚Äôre welcome to interpret the structure and naming in a way that feels clear and maintainable to you.

### Bonus (Optional)
These are not required but will help showcase your product sense:
- `POST /bulk`: Accept a list of ‚ÄúWho, What, When‚Äù entries in JSON
- Status endpoint: Count of completed commitments by week/month
- Basic authentication or user ownership control
- A simple UI or Postman collection
- Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- Parse uploaded image to a who, what, when list

---

## Something to consider

Please include short written answers (in your README or as comments in the code):
1. **How could this be used for recurring team planning (e.g. weekly check-ins)?**
2. **If this system were used by multiple teams, how would you ensure it remains useful but not cluttered?**
3. **What signals would you look for to know if this tool is actually helping a team?**

## Technical Expectations

- Use Laravel (preferred), or any modern PHP framework
- Include setup instructions
- Dockerized setup is appreciated but not mandatory
- Include any test coverage or CI steps you‚Äôd normally use
- Use migrations and sensible model structure
