# üìå Who, What, When - API Challenge

Welcome to the Hello Chef take-home challenge!

This project simulates a simple but powerful system used internally by our team: tracking **Who** is doing **What**, and **When**. It‚Äôs inspired by real accountability tools used by Product Engineering leads at Hello Chef and we‚Äôre excited to see how you bring it to life.

---

## The Goal

Build a backend API that lets users:
- Create and assign tasks to people (`Who`)
- Describe what needs to be done (`What`)
- Define a time range (`When`)
- Mark things as complete ‚úÖ

This isn‚Äôt about scale or completeness ‚Äî we want to see your **code clarity, product thinking, and ownership mindset**.

---

## Core Requirements

### Entities
You should model at least the following:
- **Person**: name, email
- **Commitment**: description (`what`), `done` status, optional tags
- **Timeframe**: start date, end date (part of a commitment)

> You may separate `Commitment` and `Event`, or keep them unified if preferred.

---

#### Filters
- By person
- By completion status
- By date range (`start_date`, `end_date`)

---

### Bonus (Optional)
These are not required but will help showcase your product sense:
- `POST /bulk`: Accept a list of ‚ÄúWho, What, When‚Äù entries in JSON
- Status endpoint: Count of completed commitments by week/month
- Basic authentication or user ownership control
- A simple UI or Postman collection
- Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- Parse uploaded image to a who, what, when list

---

## Something to consider

Please include short written answers (in your README or as comments in the code):
1. **How could this be used for recurring team planning (e.g. weekly check-ins)?**
2. **What tradeoffs would you make to support 100K+ records or users?**
3. **If your users were non-technical (e.g. ops managers), how would you adapt the interface or structure?**

---

## Technical Expectations

- Use Laravel (preferred), or any modern PHP framework
- Include setup instructions (see below)
- Dockerized setup is appreciated but not mandatory
- Include any test coverage or CI steps you‚Äôd normally use
- Use migrations and sensible model structure
